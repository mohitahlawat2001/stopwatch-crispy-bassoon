A stopwatch is a device that measures time. It is often used in sports to record the time of athletes during a race, swim, etc. Some smartphones have a feature called “Multi-timers” that lets users set multiple timers for different tasks at the same time, such as cooking.

But what if you want to have multiple stopwatches instead? For example, in a group presentation, you might want to track how long each presenter speaks. A regular stopwatch only has laps, but not multiple stopwatches.
